- ✅ **Grade Assignment** – Determines the grade (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `F`) based on percentage.
- ✅ **User-Friendly Console Output** – Displays results in a structured format.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Java** – Core programming language.
- **Scanner Class** – Handles user input.
- **Conditional Statements** – Used for grade determination.
- **Looping Constructs** – Used for mark collection.

## 📌 How It Works
1. The user enters the **number of subjects**.
2. The program prompts for **marks in each subject** (out of 100).
3. It **calculates total marks, average percentage, and assigns a grade**:
   - 90-100%→ Grade **A**
   - 80-89% → Grade **B**
   - 70-79% → Grade **C**
   - 60-69% → Grade **D**
   - <60% → Grade **F**
4. Displays the **results** including **total marks, percentage, and grade**.

## 📜 Example Output
```
Enter the number of subjects: 3 
Enter marks obtained in subject 1 (out of 100): 85 
Enter marks obtained in subject 2 (out of 100): 90 
Enter marks obtained in subject 3 (out of 100): 78
Results: Total Marks: 253 
Average Percentage: 84.33% 
Grade: B
```
